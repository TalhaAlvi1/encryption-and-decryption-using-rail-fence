Rail Fence Cipher Encryption and Decryption
Overview
The Rail Fence Cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way it's encrypted. It involves writing the plaintext in a zigzag pattern down and up across multiple "rails" (or lines) and then reading off each line to create the ciphertext. This method provides a basic level of security for messages.
How It Works
Input the Plaintext: The user inputs a message.
Create Rails: The message is written in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rails.
Read Off: The ciphertext is generated by reading off each rail sequentially.
Decryption: The process is reversed to retrieve the original plaintext.
